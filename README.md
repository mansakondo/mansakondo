* I‚Äôm 23.

## I worked on...
### Open-source projects
* A [PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43399) (extracted from a [gem](https://github.com/mansakondo/activemodel-embedding)) to model semi-structured data in Rails.
* A [gem](https://github.com/mansakondo/parallelixir) which delegates Ruby background processing to Elixir.
* A simple Rails [plugin](https://github.com/mansakondo/polymorphic_aliases) which generates aliases for your polymorphic associations.

### Sample apps
* An [application](https://karan-demo.herokuapp.com/) which indexes [encoded bibliographic data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_standards), and provides a minimal [discovery interface](https://blog.andornot.com/blog/discovery-interfaces-a-new-opac-for-libraries/) with hierarchical facets.
* A front-end [challenge](https://rest-countries-challenge.herokuapp.com/) from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca), with responsive and progressively enhanced views made with TailwindCSS and Hotwire.
* A [live Hotwire counter](https://github.com/mansakondo/hotwire-counter) deployed on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
